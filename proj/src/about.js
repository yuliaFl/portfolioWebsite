        I started coding in 10th grade when I took a computer engineering
        course. I realized I wasn't into hardware, but I found coding, like
        making a robot react to light or navigate around obstacles, more
        interesting. I then took a coding class, working with Java. For my final
        project, I used Java and GUI to recreate my parents' childhood game of a
        wolf catching eggs.

        I took the engineering course again and, as a team, we built an
        automated animal feeder from scratch, using motors, Arduino, and
        creating a Bluetooth app to control it. After high school, despite going
        into Police Foundations, I found myself coding during boring lectures. I
        decided to finish the diploma and go back to school for computer
        programming.{" "}

        Now, I'm in my last year at Humber College, getting hands-on experience
        with Java, SpringBoot, React, ReactNative, Python, PL/SQL and manual and
        automated testing. I've also learned about project management, working
        with Agile and Waterfall methodologies, and understanding how to work
        with SCRUM.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Using what I've learned at Humber, I'm working on personal projects to
        practice React and ReactNative. I'm also curious about learning more
        about C# and .NET.
