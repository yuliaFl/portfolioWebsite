      <p>
        I started coding in 10th grade when I took a computer engineering
        course. I quickly realized working with hardware was not for me. I found coding 
        a robot react to light or navigate around obstacles, more
        interesting. I then took a coding class, working with Java. For my final
        project, I used Java and GUI to recreate my parents' childhood game of a
        wolf catching eggs. I spent hours on that game, and enjoyed fixing every bug.
        The whole coding proccess became a puzzle for me.

        I took the engineering course again and, as a team, we built an
        automated animal feeder from scratch, using motors, Arduino, and
        creating a Bluetooth app to control it. After high school, despite going
        into Police Foundations, I found myself coding during boring lectures. I
        decided to finish the diploma and go back to school for computer
        programming.{" "}

        Now, I'm in my last year at Humber College, getting hands-on experience
        with Java, SpringBoot, React, ReactNative, Python, PL/SQL and manual and
        automated testing. I've also learned about project management, working
        with Agile and Waterfall methodologies, and understanding how to work
        with SCRUM.{" "}

        Currently I'm completing my last course of networking at Humber. 
        In my free time I'm working on a React course taught by Udemy.
        After completing the React course, I'm curious to learning touch on C# and .NET.
