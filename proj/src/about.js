      <p>My coding experience began back in grade 10, when I took a computer engineering course. I quickly figured out that hardware was not for me, but the coding part of getting a robot to avoid light, attack or turn around when hit a wall is much more interseting. I then took a coding course, working with Java. As a final project working with Java and GUI, i remade my parents childhood game of a wolf catching eggs. 

i took the engeneering course once again where as a team we build an automated animal feader. Building the frame from screacth, using motors, arduino, and making an app to control the feeder via blootooth. 
After highschool I chose to go into Police Foundations, but found myself working on the game in borning lectures. I decided to finish the diploma and go back to school for computer programming. 

I am currently in my last year of computer progamming at Humber College. Humber gave me a feel for Java, SpringBoot, React, ReactNative, manual and automated testing. As well, a feel for project management, working with agile and waterfall methedologies, and undersetanding how to work with SCRUM. 

Putting everything Humber has given me I am working on personal projects to practice React, and ReacNative. I also very curious of learning more about C# and .Net.</p>
